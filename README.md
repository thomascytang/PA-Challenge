# AeroPoint Programming Challenge Submission

This is the repository for my submission for the AeroPoint Challenge (https://github.com/PropellerAero/aeropoint-programming-challenge)
The challenge of handling the case where hourly logs are missing has not been completed.

Requires TEQC toolkit to use. I believe this is acceptable as the example output was created using TEQC.

## Installation instructions:
The script is an entirely self-contained bash script, so it can be downloaded and run using:

`sh grab_data.sh base_id start end`

You can also rename the file however you'd like and alter the permissions as you see fit.
